My research field is related to continuum mechanics in the non-local formulation and modeling of scale effects (in particular, mechanics of structures with nano and micro sizes). I am engaged in developing the non-local theory known as space-Fractional Continuum Mechanics and developing new mathematical and numerical models within this theory. This research was the subject of my doctoral dissertation entitled _„Structural models in the framework of space-Fractional Continuum Mechanics”_ (supervisor: Prof. Wojciech Sumelka, Poznan University of Technology). Currently, research is continued under the obtained PRELUDIUM grant, entitled [_Mechanics of bar-and-plate structures with strong scale effects – mathematical modelling and experimental analysis_](https://projekty.ncn.gov.pl/en/index.php?projekt_id=557885), no. 2022/45/N/ST8/02421, funded by the National Science Center, Poland.
